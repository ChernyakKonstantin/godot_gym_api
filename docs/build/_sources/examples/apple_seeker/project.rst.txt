Project Creating
================

In this step, we will prepare our project.

.. note::

    The original game content can be found 
`here <https://github.com/ChernyakKonstantin/godot_gym_api/tree/main/examples/apple_seeker/original_game>`_.

1. Create a project directory. In this tutorial, the project directory is ``apple_seeker``.
2. In the ``apple_seeker`` directory create ``godot`` and ``python`` directories.
3. Copy original game content from ``examples/apple_seeker/original_game`` into created ``godot`` directory.
4. Import ``godot`` directory as a project in Godot.
